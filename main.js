/*Am going to try fetch data from a weather app using an API key provided by the specific weather app. Now when some clicks on the search button you nedd to see the searched ciity popping up exactly on the page. That's where JavaScript comes in. Now I will learn slowly on hoe to fetch API key and how to apply it on the JavaScript File. First thing tomorrow is to do that thank you. Thank you for keeping me motivated @ Greatstack.*/
